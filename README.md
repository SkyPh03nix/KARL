# 🫠 Karl – A Small RPG Experiment in C++/SFML

**Karl** is a little side project I started because I wanted to start learning **SFML** and get better at **C++**. 
Instead of using a big game engine, I wanted to create something from scratch and really understand the **underlying logic of game development**. 

👉 Please note: I’m still a beginner.  
This project is mainly a **test playground** where I try out random ideas for fun and learning.

## Current Features
- A player character with simple animations (idle, walk)
- Placeable **portals** you can walk through
- **UI buttons** to change the player’s color
- A background image that currently loops infinitely
- A basic game loop (`init`, `update`, `render`)

---

## 🔮 Ideas / Goals

- 🌍 **Tilemap system** (chunk-based, possibly infinite, procedurally generated)  
- 🌳 **World objects** like trees and rocks with collision  
- 🪓 **Inventory + tools** (e.g. chop down trees with an axe)  
- 💾 **Saving/loading world changes**
